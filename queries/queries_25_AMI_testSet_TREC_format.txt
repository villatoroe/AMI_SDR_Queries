History
Zenith engineer Eugene Polley invented the Flashmatic which represented the industry s first wireless TV remote
Introduced in 1955 Flashmatic operated by means of four photo cells one in each corner of the TV screen
The viewer used a highly directional flashlight to activate the four control functions which turned the picture and sound on and off and changed channels by turning the tuner dial clockwise and counter-clockwise
While it pioneered the concept of wireless TV remote control the Flashmatic had some limitations
It was a simple device that had no protection circuits and if the TV sat in an area in which the sun shone directly on it the tuner might start rotating
